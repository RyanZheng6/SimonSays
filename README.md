# SimonSays
Simon Says game using LEDs, distance sensors, and a buzzer.
Using randomized time inputs this game makes it so that a light comes up and the player has to hover their hand over the distance sensor that corrosponds with the specific light.
If the player does not hover over the sensor fast enough the player loses 1 life. They had 3 total lives.
If a player hovers over the sensor on time then the game continues.
If the player loses all 3 lives then the buzzer will play a special song.
