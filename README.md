# SimonSays
Simon Says game using LEDs, push buttons, distance sensors, and a buzzer.
Using randomized time inputs this game makes it so that a light comes up and the player has to then push the button corrosponding with the specific light.
If the player does not push the button fast enough the player loses 1 life. They had 3 total lives.
If a player hits the button on time then the game continues.
If the player loses all 3 lives then the buzzer will play a special song.
